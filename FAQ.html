								<h3>What is ILLiad?</h3>

								<p>ILLiad is the electronic system you use to request an item through Interlibrary Loan.
								The name ILLiad can be thought of as an acronym for <u>I</u>nter<u>L</u>ibrary <u>L</u>oan <u>i</u>nternet <u>a</u>ccessible <u>d</u>atabase.</p>

						<div class="faq-item-box">
							<h3>How is ILLiad better than traditional ILL systems?</h3>

							<ol>
									<li>You will find it easier to submit your interlibrary loan requests. With ILLiad, you enter your name, address, and other personal information into the system only once, at the time of your first request.</li>
									<li>Your request will be handled more rapidly and accurately as problems relating to misinterpretation of hand-written requests are eliminated.</li>
									<li>You can get many of your photocopies more quickly through Electronic Delivery.</li>
									<li>You can get information about the status of your request through the Web at any time from any location without having to call the ILL Department.</li>
									<li>Library personnel are able to serve you better because all data about your request and its handling is stored in a searchable database. We are able to respond quickly to your
									inquiries about your request. We are also able to gather statistical information about the
									performance of the libraries that lend to us, enabling us to make better decisions when
									choosing a lender to supply an item.</li>

							<h3>What is the difference between OhioLINK and interlibrary Loan via ILLiad?</h3>

							<p>OhioLINK is only for circulating items only (books, some audio-visual materials, etc.), and should be checked before placing an ILL request.<br></p>

							<p>ILL consists of a nationwide search for items not available via OhioLINK or online.  Remember that some books and journal articles may be available on line.  If you need assistance in determining whether this is the case, please ask a reference librarian.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<a name="slower"></a>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<div class="faq-item-box">
							<h3>Why is Interlibrary Loan slower than OhioLINK?</font></h3>

							<p>OhioLINK is confined to institutions in the state of Ohio, and uses a courier service for daily pick up and delivery. <br></p>

							<p>ILL is nationwide (and sometimes international) and materials are generally sent via the U. S. Postal Service.

											<h3>Are there any disadvantages to the electronic system?</h3>

											<p>Some people might find it troublesome to have to log into ILLiad using a username and
											password. We believe this is less trouble than traditional paper and electronic systems
											which require you to enter your personal information with each new request.</p>
									</div>
							</div>

							<a name="userid"></a>
							<div class="faq-item">
									<div class="faq-item-box">
											<h3>Why do I need a username and password to use ILLiad?</h3>

											<p>Your username and password allows us to give you secure access to information about
											your interlibrary loan requests. We can also enable you to edit your personal information
											such as your address or phone number. </p>

									 <p>Your username and password are the same as you use to log on to the University of Dayton network.
									 If any of your personal information changes, you will need to update your information in ILLiad.</p>
									</div>

							<a name="password"></a>
							<div class="faq-item">
									<div class="faq-item-box">
											<h3>What if I forget my password?</h3>

											<p>Click <a href="https://password.udayton.edu" target="_self" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">here</a> to reset your University of Dayton username and password.</p>

							<a name="webbrowser"></a>
							<div class="faq-item">
									<div class="faq-item-box">
											<h3>What Web browser should I use?</h3>

											<p>You need a Web browser that can handle forms, tables, and preferrably Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). We recommend the current versions of either Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox.</p>
									</div>
							</div>

							<a name="security"></a>
							<div class="faq-item">
									<div class="faq-item-box">
											<h3>Is security a problem if I use a public workstation?</a></h3>

											<p>Yes. Web browsers cache information and create a history file on the local workstation.
											This allows a subsequent user of the workstation to access the system under your name
											using the browser's Back button to recall a page from the cache, or by finding a page with
											your personal information in the browser's history file. If you are concerned about the
											security of your interlibrary loan requests, you can take the following steps:</p>

											<ol>
													<li>Access ILLiad only from your personal computer or an otherwise secure workstation.</li>
											
											<li>When using a public access workstation close the Web browser before leaving the workstation, and always be sure to log off !</li>
															</ol>
													</li>

							</div>

							<a name="history"></a>
							<div class="faq-item">
									<div class="faq-item-box">
											<h3>Why don't I see all my older requests when I look at my request history?</h3>

											<p>From time to time we purge older records from ILLiad. Our policy is to keep
											requests online for several years order to comply with record keeping requirements
											of the copyright law.</p>

									<div class="faq-item-box">
											<h3>What is electronic delivery?</h3>

											<p>Many libraries ship photocopies of articles to us in electronic format. In the past we
											printed these articles before delivering them to you. Now, through ILLiad, we are able to
											offer you the option of electronic delivery of these articles in PDF format (Adobe's
											Portable Document Format). You can read more about electronic delivery on the <a href="ElectronicDeliveryInformation.html">Electronic Delivery
											Information</a> page.</p>

						<h3>What if I don't return my interlibrary loan on time?</h3>
						<ol>
						 
							  <li>If you keep a loan more than 14 days overdue, the ILLiad system will block your interlibrary loan privileges.  Your Roesch library borrowing privileges will be blocked as well. All privileges will be reinstated when you return the item and pay any charges incurred. </li>
							  <li>Lending libraries are less likely to let us borrow again if you keep an item overdue.  </li>
