							<h3>First Time User Registration for Interlibrary Loan</h3>                     
							
							<p>
							To request an item through Interlibrary Loan, you must first identify yourself to the library's ILLiad system. To do this you fill out a registration form using your Web browser.<br />
							Registration has two purposes:
							</p>
					
							<ul>
								<li>Entering your personal information into the ILLiad system means you will not have to supply the information again when making future requests.</li>
								<li>Having your e-mail and regular mail addresses on file with Interlibrary Loan enables us to notify you promptly and deliver materials accurately when your request arrives in the library.</li>
							</ul>
